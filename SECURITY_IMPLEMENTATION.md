# 🔒 Security Implementation Guide

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the Sphyr application.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- **Complete data isolation** between organizations
- **User-level access control** for personal data
- **Role-based permissions** for admin vs member users
- **Integration-specific policies** for OAuth tokens and sync logs

### 2. User Roles System
- **Admin role**: Full organization management capabilities
- **Member role**: Standard user access with personal data control
- **Role-based policies** that enforce different permission levels

### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Organization-level isolation**: Users can only access their organization's data
- **Cross-organization protection**: Prevents data leakage between tenants
- **Secure OAuth token storage**: User-specific token access

### 4. Comprehensive Database Security
- **All tables protected** with RLS policies
- **Function-based security** for complex access patterns
- **Audit trail capabilities** through search analytics

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply the user roles migration first
supabase db push

# Verify the migration was applied
supabase db diff --local
```

### Step 2: Apply RLS Policies
```bash
# Apply all RLS policies in order
# The policies are automatically applied when you run:
supabase db push
```

### Step 3: Seed Development Data
```bash
# Seed the database with test data
npm run db:setup
```

### Step 4: Verify Security Implementation
```bash
# Run verification queries
supabase db shell
```

In the Supabase shell, run:
```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT * FROM verify_rls_setup();

-- Test the policies
SELECT * FROM test_rls_policies();
```

## 🔍 Security Features

### Organization Isolation
```sql
-- Users can only see their organization
SELECT * FROM organizations;
-- Returns only the user's organization

-- Users cannot see other organizations' data
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Returns only users in the same organization
```

### Role-Based Access Control
```sql
-- Admins can manage organization settings
UPDATE organizations SET name = 'New Name' WHERE id = 'org-id';
-- Only works if user is admin

-- Members can only update their own profile
UPDATE users SET first_name = 'New Name' WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- Works for any authenticated user
```

### Integration Security
```sql
-- Users can only access their own integrations
SELECT * FROM integrations;
-- Returns only integrations in user's organization

-- OAuth tokens are user-specific
SELECT * FROM oauth_tokens;
-- Returns only user's own tokens
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Organization Isolation
```sql
-- Set up test user
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub": "test-user-id"}';

-- Try to access organizations
SELECT * FROM organizations;
-- Should only return user's organization
```

### Test 2: Role-Based Access
```sql
-- Test as admin user
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub": "admin-user-id"}';

-- Should be able to manage organization
UPDATE organizations SET name = 'Test' WHERE id = 'org-id';

-- Test as member user
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub": "member-user-id"}';

-- Should fail with permission denied
UPDATE organizations SET name = 'Test' WHERE id = 'org-id';
```

### Test 3: Data Privacy
```sql
-- Test search history privacy
SELECT * FROM search_queries;
-- Should only return user's own searches

-- Test integration access
SELECT * FROM integrations;
-- Should only return organization's integrations
```

## 📊 Security Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their organization's data
- ✅ **Right to Erasure**: Users can delete their own data
- ✅ **Data Portability**: Users can export their own data
- ✅ **Consent Management**: OAuth tokens require explicit user consent

### SOC 2 Compliance
- ✅ **Access Controls**: Role-based access control implemented
- ✅ **Data Encryption**: OAuth tokens are encrypted
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Search analytics provide audit trail
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Security**: Complete data isolation

### Industry Best Practices
- ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get necessary access
- ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- ✅ **Secure by Default**: RLS enabled on all tables
- ✅ **Regular Auditing**: Built-in verification functions

## 🚨 Critical Security Notes

### Production Deployment
1. **Never disable RLS** in production
2. **Test all policies** before deployment
3. **Monitor access patterns** for anomalies
4. **Regular security audits** required

### Development
1. **Use seed data** for consistent testing
2. **Test with different user roles**
3. **Verify organization isolation**
4. **Check admin vs member permissions**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "RLS policy violation"
```sql
-- Check user authentication
SELECT auth.uid();

-- Check user's organization
SELECT get_user_organization(auth.uid());

-- Check user's role
SELECT get_user_role(auth.uid());
```

#### "Function not found"
```sql
-- Verify functions exist
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%user%';

-- Re-run migration if needed
supabase db push
```

#### "No data returned"
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT * FROM verify_rls_setup();

-- Verify user has proper role
SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Indexed foreign keys** for fast policy evaluation
- **Function-based policies** for complex access patterns
- **Efficient query patterns** to minimize RLS overhead

### Monitoring
- **Query performance** should be monitored
- **Policy evaluation time** should be tracked
- **Index usage** should be verified

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
